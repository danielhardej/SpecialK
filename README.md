# Linux Kernel

I'm writing a Linux-style kernel from scratch!

## Project Structure

The project has the following files:

- `arch/x86/boot`: This directory contains the boot code specific to the x86 architecture.
- `arch/x86/kernel`: This directory contains the kernel code specific to the x86 architecture.
- `arch/x86/mm`: This directory contains the memory management code specific to the x86 architecture.
- `arch/arm/boot`: This directory contains the boot code specific to the ARM architecture.
- `arch/arm/kernel`: This directory contains the kernel code specific to the ARM architecture.
- `arch/arm/mm`: This directory contains the memory management code specific to the ARM architecture.
- `block`: This directory contains the block device drivers.
- `drivers/char`: This directory contains the character device drivers.
- `drivers/net`: This directory contains the network device drivers.
- `drivers/pci`: This directory contains the PCI device drivers.
- `drivers/usb`: This directory contains the USB device drivers.
- `fs/ext4`: This directory contains the code for the ext4 file system.
- `fs/nfs`: This directory contains the code for the NFS file system.
- `fs/vfat`: This directory contains the code for the VFAT file system.
- `include/linux`: This directory contains the header files for the Linux kernel.
- `include/asm`: This directory contains the architecture-specific header files.
- `include/uapi`: This directory contains the user-space API header files.
- `init`: This directory contains the initialization code for the kernel.
- `ipc`: This directory contains the inter-process communication code.
- `kernel`: This directory contains the core kernel code.
- `lib`: This directory contains the library code used by the kernel.
- `mm`: This directory contains the memory management code.
- `net/core`: This directory contains the core networking code.
- `net/ipv4`: This directory contains the IPv4 networking code.
- `net/ipv6`: This directory contains the IPv6 networking code.
- `scripts`: This directory contains various scripts used during the build process.
- `security`: This directory contains the security-related code.
- `sound`: This directory contains the sound drivers.
- `tools`: This directory contains various tools used for kernel development.
- `usr`: This directory contains user-space utilities.
- `virt`: This directory contains the virtualization-related code.
- `Makefile`: This file is the makefile used to build the Linux kernel.
- `README.md`: This file contains the documentation for the project.
